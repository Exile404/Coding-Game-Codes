# If the input number n is even, divide it by two, and if the result is still even repeat the process k times, until the resulting number p is odd, and output p.
# Input
# n an integer
# Output
# p an odd integer such as n=(2^k)*p
# Constraints
# 1â‰¤n<2^31
# 0â‰¤k<31
# Example
# Input
# 6
# Output
# 3
